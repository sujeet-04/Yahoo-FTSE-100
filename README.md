# Yahoo-FTSE-100
The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index, also called the FTSE 100 Index, is a share index of the 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalization. The index is maintained by the FTSE Group, a now wholly-owned subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange, which originated as a joint venture between the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange. In this analysis, the evaluation of stock performance will be done based on their last 20 yearsâ€™ annual returns and trends. By using this FTSE 100 data from yahoo I will analyze the volatility, volume, adjusted price of the stock and also will analyze the uncertainty in the stock market. First I will merge the FTSE annual data with the annual return data for all the company stock present in the list, then I will calculate the volatility and excessive return for the last 20 years for all the stock and will identify which stock showing the highest volatility and annual return, apart from that I will also analyze the volume of each company share and their trend.
